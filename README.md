 A draft requirement document outlining the authentication features that each team should implement: 
 Intern Project Requirement: User Authentication Module Overview The project aims to develop a robust user authentication system that covers both registration (sign up) and login functionalities.
 The system should support multiple social sign-ups along with a secure login mechanism using authentication tokens. This document outlines the detailed requirements for each module. 
 Scope Each team is responsible for designing, developing, and testing the following components: 	
 •	Sign Up Pages: Allow users to create an account using various third-party providers. 	
 •	Login Page: Enable users to log in and access the system securely through an authentication token mechanism. Detailed Requirements 
 1. Sign Up Module Implement sign-up functionalities that allow new users to register using the following methods:
    a. Sign Up with Facebook
  •	Integration: Utilize the Facebook SDK or API to handle OAuth 2.0 authentication.
  •	Data Retrieval: Upon successful authentication, retrieve necessary user information (e.g., email, name, profile picture) to create a user profile.
  •	Error Handling: Ensure proper handling of errors such as denied permissions or network issues.
    b. Sign Up with Gmail
  •	Integration: Use the Google OAuth API to facilitate sign-up with Gmail.
  •	Data Retrieval: Securely obtain user information (e.g., email address, full name, profile picture) required for account creation.
  •	Security: Validate tokens and handle token expiration as per Google’s guidelines.
  •	Error Handling: Address scenarios where authentication fails or required permissions are not granted.
    c. Sign Up with Apple
•	Integration: Implement Sign In with Apple using Apple’s authentication services.
•	Data Retrieval: Fetch the necessary user details (e.g., email, full name) in compliance with Apple’s privacy policies.
•	Security: Ensure proper token validation and secure storage of sensitive information.
•	Error Handling: Manage error cases including declined authentication and token issues.
2. Login Module Develop a secure login system that:
  •	Authentication Token: Issues a secure auth token (e.g., JWT) upon successful login.
  •	Validation: Verifies the auth token for subsequent user requests.
  •	Session Management: Implements secure session handling practices, including token expiration and refresh mechanisms.
  •	Error Handling: Provides clear error messages for failed logins, including invalid credentials or expired tokens. General Requirements
  •	Security Best Practices: Ensure all authentication flows adhere to current security standards (e.g., HTTPS, secure storage of tokens).
  •	User Experience: Design intuitive and responsive UI/UX for both sign up and login pages.
  •	Testing: Include unit and integration tests for all authentication flows to ensure reliability and security.
  •	Documentation: Provide clear documentation for the implemented authentication flows, including integration guides for third-party APIs.
  •	Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when handling user data. Deliverables
  •	Codebase: A well-structured repository with documented source code.
  •	API Documentation: Detailed API documentation for all authentication endpoints.
  •	Test Cases: A comprehensive suite of tests covering all scenarios.
  •	Deployment Guide: Instructions on how to deploy the authentication modules in a staging/production environment.dates.
